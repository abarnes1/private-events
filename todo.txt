1. event_attendance#destroy
  - can I get primary key? current solution is questionable

2. database activity
  - event#show takes 3 queries when host, 4 when guest
    - can this be reduced?

3. when/where to use forms vs. links
  - event attendance is created with form but delete with link
    - can a form be used for both? should a form be used for both?

4. flash messages

5. protect against failed create/update/destroy in controllers
